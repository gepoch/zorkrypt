# zorkrypt

An exploration of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm in the medium of a
command line adventure game.

Basically, this just takes the steps involved in D.H. key exchange, and breaks
them into some simple character roles which you can take control of. The goal
is ultimately to foil the evil and possibly demonic-terrorist-communist Eve,
while transmitting the sacred and good data payload.

This is mostly fun, and it might even be *useful* to anyone who wants to get a
grip of the process on a low level. Imagine that!

## Some stuff to do:

- Play as Alice.
- Play as Bob.
- Play as Eve.
- Implement the xyzzy cheat code!
- Multiple trapdoor functions.
